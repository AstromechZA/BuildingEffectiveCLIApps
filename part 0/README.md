# Part 0 - A Terrible Introduction

```
$ go build
```

Lets see what we have here..

1. `./part\ 0`

2. `./part\ 0 --help`

3. `man ./part\ 0`

4. `./part\ -1 hello`

5. `./part\ 0 hello world`

6. `echo $?`

7. hmm. go look on stack overflow.. aha!

8. `./part\ 0 10 world`

9. Now we go celebrate about how awesome **free** software is!!11!!

10. *We can't even report bugs since we have no idea what version, build, repository, this is from or who even wrote it in the first place..*

Guess we can only go up from here!

**Note**: If your CLI's behave like this you should celebrate, since you have a lot of easy tickets ahead of you.

## Prioritizing Improvement

Now were know there are lots of things that can change here, but they come down to a few main areas (in no particular order):

### Respect your users

How do you *think* users (noobs and experts!) are going to use your app. How are users *actually* going to use your app.

### Respect yourself

Increase confidence in your code.

### Respect the environment

Users have different operating systems, hardware, shells, platforms, screen sizes, font sizes, languages, etc...

### Be Transparent

Be open to feedback and bug reports. Provide points of contact. Notify users about updates, security issues, compatibility breakages.
